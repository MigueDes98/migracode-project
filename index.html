<h1 id= "MainTitle">Empires from Classical Antiquity</h1>
<p>Classical Antiquity was a period in human history that began in the 8th century BC and ended in the 6th century AD with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the beginnig of the Middle Ages. This period is centered around the cultural history of the mediterranean civilizations, particulary Greece and Rome, both of which flourished during this time and became very influential across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, there were also many breakthroughs in philosophy, mathematics, architecture and literature. The culture of the greco roman world of this period would serve as inspiration for artists of the reinassance period. This was also a time where great empires came to power, spanning over continents and ruling over countless of people as well as wielding great power and influence.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most famous empire of this era and one of the most famous empires in history,<strong> the Roman Empire began in 27 BC with the rule of emperor Augustus</strong> (who was the nephew and adoptive son of Julius Caesar) and spawned over much of Europe as well as North Africa and parts of the Middle East. The Roman Empire was also arguably the longest standing empire in history although there is some debate regarding wether the Byzantine Empire should be considered as a continuation of the eastern roman empire or a different entity.<br> The Roman Empire was known for it's professional army: the legions, which were renowned for their training and dicipline and allowed the empire to expand it's borders and become a military dominant force for centuries.The empire also greatly influenced western civilization, taking and expanding upon the hellenistic culture, such as arquitecture, philosophy and art. Roman law has also been very influential in the legal sistems of the west and we cant forget about christianity, a religion that was born on the empire and later expanded across and beyond it's borders.</p>

  <p>The Achaemenid Empire (also known as the first Persian Empire)<strong> was founded in 550 BC  by Cyrus the Great</strong> and became the largest empire in history at that time, ruling over approximetly 44% of the human population, the largest precentage of any empire in history. This empire also implemented many things that would be copied by other empires and civilizations such as the construction of a network of roads throught it's territory, the development of a postal service and the use of a single language for their administration: the aramaic. The persian religion, Zoroastrianism was monotheistic and it is believed to have greatly influenced the develpment of the abrahamic religions.<br> One of the main things that set this empire apart from all the civilizations that came before it was it's tolerance, as the persians accepted people from different origins and faiths, allowing them to practice their religion without being discriminated against and instead of destroying the economies of their conquered kingdoms for their own benefit, they instead worked to increase trading across their territories.</p>

  <p><strong>The empire of Alexander the Great started after his ascension to power in 336 BC</strong>, his father Phillip II had already consolidated Macedonia as a major power by conquering most of Greece and radically changing the tactics and equipment of his armies, he had also planned an invasion of the Persian Empire but was assasinated before this could happen, Alexander continued his father's plans and after reconsolidating macedonian rule over Greece he set out for Persia and was able to conquer all of the Achaemenid Empire, before continuing further east until reaching the northern parts of India. During his short reign, Alexander tried to bring the greek and persian worlds together, by respecting and even adopting many persian customs, marrying persian women (and ordering his officers to do the same) and even employing persian soldiers in his army, the empire however did not last long, being divided between Alexander's generals, almost innmediatly after his death in 323 BC. <br>Although the macedonian empire was brief, it left behind a huge legacy as it allowed the hellenistic culture to spread over the middle east and even reach certain parts of India, there was an increase in contacts and trading between East and West, it expanded the knowledge of the world to the hellenistic people and many of the cities he founded such as Alexandria in Egypt became major cultural centers.</p>
